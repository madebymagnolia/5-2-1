# 5-2-1: A TV Decision Making Concept

**For a couple, deciding what to watch on iPlayer or Netflix can be a tricky, prolonged and sometimes fruitless process. This concept aims to eliminate this problem by turning the process into a game: 5-2-1**.

Having read this #lifeprotip on reddit recently, it occurred to me that this decision making process could be applied to the process of choosing something to watch.

It also occurred to me that the decision making processes used in design sprints (dot voting, the notion of a decider who’s votes count double etc.) to wrangle multiple stakeholders into a consensus may also have some application here. 

So 5:2:1 exists as the first step towards exploring how decision making techniques can be applied to television.
